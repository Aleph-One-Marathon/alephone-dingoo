INSTALL

Make sure boost is installed in the dingux toolchain.

Linux users can probably find bjam in their repo, cygwin users can build bjam
from source (native, doesn't need to go in toolchain!).

After that's been taken care of:
sh dingoo-configure.sh && make

You'll find the 'alephone' binary in the Source_Files dir if everything went OK.
