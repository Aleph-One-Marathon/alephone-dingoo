To view my source changes:
- Get WinMerge or a similar folder compare tool
- Download the original 20091015 source and compare

Very handy tool. If you can't use it, try the Dingoo.diff.html file.

All changes are commented. Or should be. The few lines of own code I
inserted may be considered public domain, there's no need to GPLify
your project or credit if you use the swgamma thingy for example.
